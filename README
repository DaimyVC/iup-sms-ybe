This is the supplementary material of the submission "IPASIR-UP: User 
Propagators for CDCL" to SAT'23. It contains supplement regarding the following
tools:
(1) CaDiCaL with IPASIRUP
(2) SAT modulo Symmetries (SMS) solver
(3) cvc5 - Satisfiability modulo Theories (SMT) solver

0. Unzip the three included zip files into one folder.

1. CaDiCaL with IPASIRUP:
--------------------------
The solver can be found in the folder 'cadical-user-propagation'.
To configure and build CaDiCaL with user propagators simply run:

    cd cadical-user-propagation/
    ./configure
    make

which will produce the 'cadical' binary and the 'libcadical.a' library in the
'cadical-user-propagation/build/' folder. Check out the 
'cadical-user-propagation/README.md' and 'cadical-user-propagation/BUILD.md' for
more details and build instructions.

- The user propagation related code is in the following source file:
    'cadical-user-propagation/src/external_propagate.cpp'

- The ExternalPropagator interface can be found here:
    'cadical-user-propagation/src/cadical.hpp' in lines 976-1030.

2. SAT modulo Symmetries
-------------------------
This version of SMS requires clingo to be installed. For instructions on how to
setup clingo, check out the 'sms-cpp-impl/README.md' file. After that, to build
SMS with CaDiCaL first follow the steps of (1) and then run:

    cd sms-cpp-impl/
    ./buildScript.sh

For the details on how to execute the experiments reported in the paper, see the
description in 'sms-cpp-impl/README.md'.

- The implementation of the ExternalPropagator class is in the following file:
    'sms-cpp-impl/src/solveCadicalClass.hpp'

3. cvc5 with CaDiCaL:
----------------------
The version of cvc5 that uses CaDiCaL with IPASIR-UP as the main SAT engine is
in the folder cvc5-cdclt-cadical.
It requires CaDiCaL to be installed (run 'make install' in (1)). Then, check out
'cvc5/INSTALL.rst' for the detailed build and installation instructions of cvc5.

- The implementation of the ExternalPropagator class is in the following file:
	./cvc5-cdclt-cadical/src/prop/cadical.cpp
