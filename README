This is the supplementary material of the submission "IPASIR-UP: User 
Propagators for CDCL" to SAT'23. It contains supplement regarding the following
tools:
(1) CaDiCaL with IPASIRUP
(2) SAT modulo Symmetries (SMS) solver for YBE Problem

0. Unzip the three included zip files into one folder.

1. CaDiCaL with IPASIRUP:
--------------------------
The solver can be found in the folder 'cadical-user-propagation'.
To configure and build CaDiCaL with user propagators simply run:

    cd cadical-user-propagation/
    ./configure
    make

which will produce the 'cadical' binary and the 'libcadical.a' library in the
'cadical-user-propagation/build/' folder. Check out the 
'cadical-user-propagation/README.md' and 'cadical-user-propagation/BUILD.md' for
more details and build instructions.

- The user propagation related code is in the following source file:
    'cadical-user-propagation/src/external_propagate.cpp'

- The ExternalPropagator interface can be found here:
    'cadical-user-propagation/src/cadical.hpp' in lines 976-1030.

2. ybe-sms
-------------------------
To build ybe-sms with CaDiCaL first follow the steps of (1) and then run:

    cd ybe-sms/
    cmake . -B./build
    cd build
    make

The executable can be found in the folder build/src 
    



- The implementation of the ExternalPropagator class is in the following file:
    'sms-cpp-impl/src/solveCadicalClass.hpp'
